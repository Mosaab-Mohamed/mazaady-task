## Running the Application

To run the application:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

The task has been completed according to the specified requirements, which are divided into two parts:

## 1. Form Categories Components

The form categories components can be accessed by clicking the `Categories` button in the header. For this part, I opted to use the Mantine UI library and integrated their components into the application.

## 2 Static Design Page

The static design page represents the home page and can be accessed via the home button in the header. It is responsive for both web and small mobile screens, following the provided design. I utilized Tailwind CSS for styling as per the requirements and did not write any custom styles. All styles and classes used are from the Tailwind CSS framework.
